# A1P1_Tree
 Assignment 1 of Non Linear Data structures and algorithms where the task was to implement a binary search tree using recursion.<br />
 
 ## Project specifiction:<br />
 **Goal of the Assignment**:<br />
In this assignment the ADT myBinarySearchTrees<T1, T2> has been extended with 4 new operations: 
1. public int my_count_at_level(int level);<br />
This operation receives as an input the level of the tree we are looking for, and returns the amount of nodes placed on that level. 
2. public boolean my_is_balanced();<br />
A binary tree is balanced when the length of its two subtrees (left subtree and right subtree) do not differ in more than 1 unit, and the proper left subtree and right subtree are balanced trees as well). This operation returns if the tree is balanced or not. 
3. public int my_count_smaller_nodes(T1 key);<br />
This operation receives as an input a key, and returns the amount of nodes in the tree with smaller key values. 
4. public int my_find_node_at_level(T1 key);<br />
This operation receives as an input a key, and returns the level were the node is located.

Exercise: Implement the 4 methods in the class myBinarySearchTreeImpl.java using recursion. Note that the methods that have a key as input, must use the advantages of binary search trees by exploring only the right subtree or the left subtree in case that the othersubtree can be discarded. Note: You can reuse any of the other 16 defined operations if you want.
 
**Background**:<br />
The Abstract Data Type (ADT) myBinarySearchTrees<T1, T2> allows to store nodes with the 
format (T1 key, T2 value). Whereas T2 can be any datatype (e.g., an Integer, a String, a myPlayer, etc.), the datatype T1 is constrained to have a total order relationship â‰¤ (i.e., two elements T1 elem_i and T1 elem_j can be compared and sorted). The ADT myBinarySearchTrees<T1, T2> supports the set of operations that we have seen in the lectures, and it is specified in the interface myBinarySearchTree.java.
1. //public myBinarySearchTree<T1, T2> create_from_binary_search_node( 
 myBinarySearchNode<T1, T2> n);
2. public boolean my_is_empty();
3. public myBinarySearchNode<T1, T2> my_root();
4. public myBinarySearchTree<T1, T2> my_left_tree() throws myException;
5. public myBinarySearchTree<T1, T2> my_right_tree() throws myException;
6. public myBinarySearchNode<T1,T2> my_find(T1 key);
7. public myBinarySearchTree<T1, T2> my_insert(T1 key, T2 info);
8. public myBinarySearchTree<T1, T2> my_remove(T1 key);
9. public int my_length();
10. public int my_node_count();
11. public int my_leaf_count();
12. public myList<T2> my_inorder();
13. public myList<T2> my_preorder();
14. public myList<T2> my_postorder();
15. public myBinarySearchNode<T1, T2> my_maximum() throws myException;
16. public myBinarySearchNode<T1, T2> my_minimum() throws myException;

All the operations are implemented in the class myBinarySearchTreeImpl.java.- myMain.java: This class tests the functionality of the trees. Please, have a detailed look and 
also run it to test if your code is right. The first thing that you must do, is to draw in your notebook the trees that are defined in this file.
